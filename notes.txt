"You" are a God - or rather, more accurately, a statue in the middle of town. Or you *will* be, anyway: right now you're a rock, and the "town" is at best a 
river-side village. You influence the development of the town - the rulers, and the people themselves - to grow its size and power, and by extension your own.
Individual citizens exist or don't given on the game mode; can take control of armies directly. Have to answer prayers and portents; rivalries with other gods.
World is structured to make it very difficult to make a lasting empire, beyond the reign of a single ruler (under your guidance, of course). Effectively a roguelike.

To start development: make a 1000x1000 (1 square kilometre) map. Create "house" class - an x and y location, and a width and height - and a linked list (or some 
other collection) of houses. Repeatedly ask user "do you want to place a house?" If they say yes, create a new house of random size and location within the map, 
alternately pan around the map in response to user commands. Make more an more complex systems for building placement, eventually creating a city from asking the 
user for advice - i.e. not directly taking orders from the user.

#Ur

Ur is supposed to be a God game, in which you influence the goings-on in a world through your believers, with open ended goals.

##What it is now

A NCURSES program (part of #PetraCURSES) that has a 2D city of defined size containing buildings and "beings" which can path through them. The beings can use doors etc and path using A*. Pathing is not as fast as I'd like, but it works.

##Plans

* Beings interact with the world
* Player can influence events
* City grows
* Multiple cities and areas
* Implement graphically in some way
